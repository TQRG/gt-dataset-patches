# NVD Tool

ðŸ”— [https://www.cvedetails.com/ data](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds).

All the resulting datasets are available at `~/data/nvd/` (in case you want to check it). 

### 1. Getting the raw data

The **raw dataset** is not available in the repository. There are two ways of getting the dataset:

1. Scrape the entire NVD data by running the following script:

```bash
source download.sh
```
This script will save the data by `year` in `~/data/nvd/year/`.

2. Download our google cloud mirror by running the following command:
   
```bash
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc\?id\=18VCNv--uhzmI8NGgOz_9DDCx5sJENUtJ
```

### 2. Generate Dataset

Generate the dataset with references to commits in source code hosting websites such as `github`, `bitbucket`, `gitlab` and `git`.

1. Merge, plot stats and normalize NVD data:
```bash
source generate_data.sh
```

2. Filter NVD data by source code hosting website (`github`, `bitbucket`, `gitlab` or `git`):

```bash
source filter_data_by_source.sh github
```
